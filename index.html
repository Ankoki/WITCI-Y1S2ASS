                    <h4>An Introduction to Cyber Security</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cybersecurity is more important in today's society than you would think.
                        The majority of your day-to-day life goes through the internet, such as Snapchat photos,
                        Whatsapp messages and Instagram posts, but what stops these from being accessed by unwanted
                        people?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start, lets see how Cyber Crime affects the public.
                    </p>
                    <list>
                        <ol>
                            <li>32% of small businesses in the UK have experienced a breach or cyberattack in the last 12 months.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>There were 2,365 cyberattacks in 2023, with a total of 343,338,964 victims. [This is a 72% increase from 2021, the previous record for cyber crime]</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>A data breach can cost a company roughly $4.45 million.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Malware is most commonly delivered by e-mail.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>94% of organizations have reported e-mail security reports.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Information security jobs are projected to grow by 32% between 2022 and 2032.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ol>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                        This may be scary, but let's take a deeper look on what type of attacks you may be at risk of.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Phishing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Phishing makes use of messages, e-mails, websites and other forms of communication to trick people
                        into downloading malware [we will learn more about this later], or exposing their personal data.
                        Attackers will commonly act as an organisation to expose your login details. Think about all
                        the texts you've seen go around from 'Royal Mail' about a package you never ordered.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Spear Phishing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Spear Phishing is where attackers will send personalised emails and/or texts to their victim, which
                        are usually directed straight into your spam folder!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Whaling</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is where someone will specifically attack a senior employee at a company, or someone with high
                        level access, and then use them to extract company data.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Vishing</h4>
                    <p>
                        This requires the attackers to leave voice mails or audio messages in the victim's inbox, pretending
                        to be a reputable source [like your bank], to gain access to the victim's account.
                    </p>
                    <h4>E-mail Phising</h4>
                    <p>
                        This type of Phishing targets mass audiences, with company based e-mails in the hope someone in the
                        audience will fall for the trap, allowing access to confidential data.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Malware</h4>
                    <p>
                        We briefly touched on malware earlier, but what is malware? It is software that is designed to
                        damage, disturb or gain unauthorized access to a device. You've most likely heard of the 'Trojan'
                        virus, which will break your device, however behind the scenes, they do more than just stop you
                        being able to use the device. They'll take all of your data beforehand.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Malware Statistics</h4>
                    <list>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Malware attacks rose by 71% between 2016 and 2021.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Ransomware attack victims rose by 128.17% between 2022 and 2023.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>At any given time, an estimated 4.1 million sites have malware installed.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Ransomware attacks can cost businesses an average of $5.13 million.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Ransomware accounts for roughly 24% of malicious cybercrime.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ol>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                        You may have noticed we used the word Ransomware occasionally here, but what is ransomware?
                        Ransomware is a specific type of malware, which holds important documents and systems hostage
                        until a criteria is met, usually a ransom [hence the name].
                    </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Distributed Denial of Service [DDoS]</h4>
                    <p>
                        DDoS may ring a bell if you've ever played minecraft, as servers used to go down due to DDoS
                        attacks, but what are they? A distributed denial of service attack is when the attacker
                        overloads a server with a bunch of packets, causing the server to crash. This volume of traffic
                        from the attackers makes it so that legitimate users cannot access the server.
                    </p>
                    <h4>DDoS Statistics</h4>
                    <list>
                        <ol>
                            <li>On average, Microsoft mitigates 1.7k DDoS attacks daily.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>20% of sites that offer DDoS services were established in 2023.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>The most common DDoS attack victims include Amazon Web Services [AWS], GitHub, and Dyn.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ol>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                        These kinds of attacks are very common, however software such as Cloudflare can be deployed onto
                        a server, which will check the authenticity of the packets sent. This is why before accessing a website
                        sometimes it has to check you aren't a robot, to stop these attacks.
                    </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Personal Data Breaches</h4>
                    <p>
                        Personal Data Breaches is where information stored about yourself is unlawfully deleted, lost,
                        or accessible to people who should not be able to see it. This is less of an attack, and more of a
                        result of the previous types of attacks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Personal Data Breach Statistics</h4>
                    <list>
                        <ol>
                            <li>353,027,892 people were affected by a data breach in 2023.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>The CSN[Consumer Sentinel Network] received more than 5.4 million reports in 2022, compiled mainly of Fraud and Identity Theft.</li>
                            <br>

                    <p>
                        People having access to information about you may be scary, however there are ways you can keep safe
                        while still having a good time on the internet.

                    <h4>Vulnerability Management</h4>
                    <p>
                        Now we've learnt about the risks, what can you do to keep safe? Well, there are a lot of easy
                        ways to protect yourself, and this may seem common knowledge, but when you get home, check your
                        devices for these flaws. You'd be surprised!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Update your Software</h4>
                    <p>
                        This may seem simple, however how many times have you pressed 'update later' on your computer
                        because you're playing a game, or working on homework? Updating to the latest version of your
                        operating system is essential, as they usually ship with vulnerability protection, patching
                        bugs from the last patch that slipped through the cracks. This makes it certain that you are up-to-date
                        with the security in place, and you cannot have any of the known [and patched] attacks used against you.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Public WiFi</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you're out and you don't have any data left, it's very tempting to connect to free public
                        wi-fi to reply to your friends or post a picture, however this is more dangerous than it may seem.
                        Public wi-fi is rarely encrypted, so this means anyone can connect to it and read all the data going
                        between devices and the internet, allowing your data to be stolen, including whatever you have sent!
                    </p>
                    <h4>E-mail Anti-Spoofing</h4>
                    <p>
                        This prevents cyber criminals sending emails pretending to be you, a technique also known as email spoofing.
                        This may seem confusing, however, the
                        <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/email-security-and-anti-spoofing/configure-anti-spoofing-controls-">
